In general, the research of traffic sign recognition is divided into sign detection and sign classification, and thus, this project has been divided in two main objectives: getting a working model for traffic signs classification, then integrate the model into a box proposal network to identify the location of the signs inside an image.
We will first start by investigating the differences in terms of performances between a classic dense neural network and a convolutional neural network. Then, we will try to improve the classification accuracy using an advanced technique known as Transfer Learning. Finally, we will integrate one chosen model into a traffic sign detector.

Code of different models are in different folders and please see the `report.pdf` for details.
